1)check if it’s a single measurement or group of measurement 
2) we have to do correlation check
3)check the track id database (should be global) and see track id it belong if its an existing track id 
If it’s a single measurement -> if it matches the existing track id -> check the state if poss 1,tentative 1,firm (if its poss 1 do Initialize filter state,if its tent 1 do Initialize filter state and get the velocity vx,vy,vz, if its firm  do start filtering (do predict and update step)

If it’s a multiple measurement -> if it matches the existing track id -> check the state if poss 1,tentative 1,firm -> perform JPDA(clusters,hypothesis and take the best hypothesis report as measurment for this step )->(if its poss 1 do Initialize filter state,if its tent 1 do Initialize filter state and get the velocity vx,vy,vz, if its firm  do start filtering (do predict and update step)

If the measurement is not correlating or assigned to any exisiting track id -> then Initiate a new track id (take the free state from the track database)-> then assign that measurement to poss1 state and do Initialize filter state
